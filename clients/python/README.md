# TensorIO Models Python client

This library exposes autogenerated gRPC clients to TensorIO Models repository and flea APIs.

The autogenerated files have been lightly modified to conform to conventional Python module
structure. Installing this library also provides you with all the dependencies required to run
the clients.

For more information on instantiating gRPC clients, see the documentation on
[gRPC Python Basics](https://grpc.io/docs/tutorials/basic/python/).
